I was given an excel file containing survey responses of individuals with regards to their favourite food choices. Some responses were open ended while some were categorial. 
I created a python program that checked duplicated entries, saw weather the open ended questions were similar (through heat maps), performed some analysis on the data, and calculated correlation of the open ended responses and other responses through tokenization.
